WEEKEND-REDUX-FEEDBACK-LOOP
## Description

This assignment wanted the class to each make a version of the reflection system that we have to use every day after class ends. It is made up of 6 different pages that all cycle together. The first 4 are questions asking you to fill out a number or write down your thoughts. the Fifth page is a review of all the inputs you have entered and the last page is a conformation that your data has been sent off to the database. 

This assignment used React for the client and Redux as a means of sending things back and forth on the client. Once everything was formulated properly it was sent to the database via axios.
